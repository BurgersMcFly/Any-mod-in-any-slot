# Any Mod In Any Slot

Can equip any melee weapon mod, ranged weapon mod, clothing mod in any melee weapon, ranged weapon, clothing and arms cyberware mod slot. With [Weapon Mod Overdrive](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1714) support! 

That means that you can also equip mods that increase damage to clothing mod slots, but they won't actually increase your damage. Can equip mods that increase your armor to weapons, but they won't do anything. Same with fire rate mods on melee weapons and reload speed mods.
